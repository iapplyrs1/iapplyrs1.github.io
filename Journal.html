					<p class="more_text" style='display:none'> I cannot believe it has already been 8 weeks. It feels like the Summer just started yesterday. This Summer has been filled with a lot of growth academically, in my research, and with my programming prowess. The networking opportunities I have received are invaluable. I was able to receive a mentor through the IAAMCS program and connect with a few first year PhD students through the BOE program at UF. </p>

          <p class="more_text" style='display:none'> After much deliberation, I believe I have a solid research design. I worked on drafting the design and should have it approved by Dr. Gilbert before submitting an IRB. In the mean time, I have been working on my programming skills and studying for the GRE. I hope to develop better programming skills to become a better researcher in grad school. </p>

          <p class="more_text" style='display:none'> I had a very important meeting with my PI Dr. Gilbert this week. It seems that I was looking at my research through the wrong lens and need to create a completely new research design. I was looking to affect too many variables in my research and possibly tainted the information. It is a bit frustrating because this new design dynamic is different from the papers I have read. </p>

          <p class="more_text" style='display:none'> Though we are technically off for the Summer, I was given the opportunity to travel to Atlanta to give an oral presentation on my research on "Consumer grade Brain Computer Interfaces as a form of Authentication and Control." The judges stated that I articulated my research well and made it very informative. I am sure that if I had more conclusive data, I would have receive an award recognition. I am thankful for the DREU and McNair program for giving me this opportunity #TrioWorks. </p>

          <p class="more_text" style='display:none'> As a McNair scholar, I have been given the opportunity to receive GRE classes for free. So every tuesday and thursdays, I cover the Math and reading sections of the GRE. When we are not in class, I practice on my own by reviewing problems and reading test materials. I am looking to retake the GRE around August 15th, I am hoping to receive a better score. </p>
